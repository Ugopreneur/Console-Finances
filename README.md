## Overview

The goal was to try and apply my newly learned Javascript skills (Iterating over arrays and writing basic for loops) in developing a simple financial analysis tool for use in a real-world situation. Hence, I wrote some code to analyze the financial records of a company using a financial dataset (received in form of an array) that shows the companies profit and loss numbers on a month by month basis for about 84 months.

## Usage

Simply replace the file index.js with the dataset to be analysed. Please ensure the array within that file follows the same format as the existing dataset.

## Built With

- Basic HTML
- Very litte CSS
- Beginner-level Javascript: Variables, methods, For Loops, Functions, Manipulating HTML DOM
